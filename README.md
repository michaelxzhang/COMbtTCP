# COMbtTCP
Connect Serial port to TCP(client, or Server)

Originally source code are from https://sourceforge.net/projects/combytcp/

Made some changes on the original code to save the settings and use one button to start and stop.

Can be used with Com0Com on local and connect to a remote port server which connected to a serial device.
